Paideia aims at making lives easier for all of us by brining knowlege that we need in day to day lives one step closer to all of us. This is an android app using which one can point their phone at quite literally anything and get information about it. For instance, when you want to know more about the fruit that is sitting beside you or when you just want to "learn" more about the stuff that is around you, Paideia helps you start off. Here is some of the info given by Paideia about random stuff that is around us:
